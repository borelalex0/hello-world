# hello-world
This is my first project on Github

> I'm an ***aspiring software developer*** with a background in accounting and finance. While working as a manager in accounting I quickly realized that so many of our workflows were limited by the software we were using and the integrations that simply weren't available to us. I utilized excel to automate as many of our processes as I could, but there was so much that was still lacking. This is what inpsired me to try my hand in software developement.
